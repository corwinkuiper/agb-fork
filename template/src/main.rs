// Games made using `agb` are no_std which means you don't have access to the standard
// rust library. This is because the game boy advance doesn't really have an operating
// system, so most of the content of the standard library doesn't apply.
//
// Provided you haven't disabled it, agb does provide an allocator, so it is possible
// to use both the `core` and the `alloc` built in crates.
#![no_std]
// `agb` defines its own `main` function, so you must declare your game's main function
// using the #[agb::entry] proc macro. Failing to do so will cause failure in linking
// which won't be a particularly clear error message.
#![no_main]

use agb::{display, syscall};

// The main function must take 0 arguments and never return. The agb::entry decorator
// ensures that everything is in order. `agb` will call this after setting up the stack
// and interrupt handlers correctly.
